# My-Projects
Here are my current projects!

1. MCipher (Substition Encryption)
  -- Allows a user to encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom cipher that I created. I utilized html, css, and                    Javascript to build this project. I also added the feature to randomized the key. To do this, you must make the changes          commented within the code (changes are in the html and JavaScript files).
