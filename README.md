# My-Projects
Here are my current projects!

1. MCipher (Substition Encryption)
  -- This project allows a user to encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom cipher that I created. I also added the feature         to randomized the key. To do this, you must make the changes commented within the code (changes are in the html and              JavaScript files).
